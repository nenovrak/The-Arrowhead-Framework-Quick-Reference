An asset can be:
- a sensor, e.g., a temperature sensor, a pressure sensor, or a complete weather station.
- an actuator, e.g., a pump, a valve.
- a complex combination of sensors and actuators, e.g., a robot manipulator.
- a database, e.g., a service registry or a data manager.
- a human machine interface, e.g., an app on a smart phone.
- another IoT Framework, e.g., [Fiware](https://www.fiware.org).
