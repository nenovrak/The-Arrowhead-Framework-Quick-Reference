Systems Engineering Definition
========

The term “Systems Engineering” is not old. It can be traced to the 1940’s at Bell Labs. 
To illustrate what it is about, NASA’s Apollo program is usually cited. This is the program that brought humans to the moon. 
Errors in the execution of any spaceflight are not allowed. For example, with Apollo 11, the rocket and the spacecraft with its three modules had to work together with no flaws and without waste. 
A trial and error development were not possible.

A short definition of Systems Engineering is: 
“Systems engineering is a methodical, disciplined approach for the design, realization, technical management, operations, and retirement of a system” [^INCOSE].
A longer definition is: 
“Systems Engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems. 
It focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, and then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem: operations, cost and schedule, performance, training and support, test, manufacturing, and disposal. 
SE considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs” [^NASA]. 
Systems Engineering has emerged within industry to address system complexity, inter-disciplinary communication and the need to clarify the customer’s needs.
