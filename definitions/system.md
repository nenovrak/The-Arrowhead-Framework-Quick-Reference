System Defintion
===========

The word [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) is often used, yet what one really means might be blurry.

Looking it up in a dictionary, one can find "a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network".  When applied to physiology, it is a set of organs in the body with a common structure or function, e.g., the digestive system.

One definition is: 
“a combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes, an integrated set of elements, subsystems, or assemblies that accomplish a defined objective. 
These elements include products (hardware, software, firmware), processes, people, information, techniques, facilities, services, and other support elements” [^NASA]. 
An example would be an air transportation system or an industrial process.

So, if one considers a pump, it can be considered as a system since it has many components (stator, rotor, etc.) or it can be considered as a component to a system that uses a pump, e.g., a cooling system.
The meaning of the word system might seem to belong to the eye of the beholder (a pump manufacturer or a plumber).
One need therefore to define the boundaries of the system.
